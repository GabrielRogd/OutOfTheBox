# OutOfTheBox
(For the moment, very early stage, and at the same time old) Python-written utility for freshly-installed Windows operating systems, a Ninite alternative (wannabe) in other words.

I started this back in 2020, but only implemented the GUI.

You know the drill: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
